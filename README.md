This is a stub for SMTP service. 
It aims to answer SMTP requests and store all received emails into local filesystem.
I made it modular in order to be able to change storage system as required (currently, only file based storage is implemented).

I expect in future releases to add a few features like
- TLS support
- a webmail like client based on the emails storage
- some POP3 or IMAP features
